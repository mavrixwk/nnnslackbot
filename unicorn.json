["I love how you just wear anything!",
"I wish I could go out with my hair unbrushed",
"Somehow that smell just works for you",
"I wish I could do fashion on a budget like you do.",
"Are you dating Riker? Good for you, scoring someone out of your league",
"Can I borrow your shoes? They're just so much more broken in and comfy than mine.",
"OMG I love your make up, you can't even see that scar.",
"Wow you must have great hearing with those ears.",
"You look like a Kardashian.",
"I like you because I’m not intimidated by you. Well, not that I think men should be intimidated by women anyway.",
"Out of all my friends with whom I could have said I had the worst sex in the world last night, I’m glad it was you.",
"You don’t look like that much of a boy with your hair that short.",
"The extra curve actually works on you.",
"I’m glad you’re not one of those girls that thinks she needs to lose weight. You don’t want to be skinny anyway.",
"You’re really pretty for a big girl.",
"You’re the whole package! You’re funny, talented, smart… I mean, if you were only skinnier you’d be absolutely perfect.",
"You’re not like obese, you’re like… skinny-fat.",
"This dress is way too big on me, so I think it will look really great on you!",
"You can dance really well for a fat girl.",
"Wow, you really get pretty when you lose weight!",
"Hey, let me know if you ever want help losing weight!",
"You’d look healthier if you lost 20 pounds.",
"You should dye your hair brunette. Your blonde hair really doesn’t make you look as intelligent as you actually are.",
"Well, you look really pretty when you put on some mascara and dress nice…",
"You’re much better looking in person than in pictures.",
"You grew into your head.",
"You got prettier in college.",
"This isn’t really yours, is it? Thank God you blossomed…you should get your picture retaken.",
"You’re still pretty even though you have a big nose.",
"It must be so nice to have such small boobs.",
"You kind of look like you’re 13. But that’ll come in handy when you’re old!",
"You’re very detail-oriented but since you have issues with flexibility you’ll need a job where you basically do the same thing every day.",
"You’re a lot smarter than I thought!",
"It must be great to be an only child. You’re so used to being alone.",
"I wish I could be more like you and not have any feelings.",
"You’re so much nicer and smarter than what people say about you.",
"You’re talented? But you’re in a sorority!",
"I can't belive your boyfriedn left you.",
"You're smarter than you look.",
"I love how you don't care what you look like",
"You look so good that I didn't recognize you.",
"I didn't recognize you! You look beautiful!",
"I wish I had cute, tiny boobs like yours.",
"I love that outfit! You're so brave.",
"I wish I was as good at Algebra as you. But between student council and date night with Riker, I just can't find the time to study!",
"You're so confident when you sing, it's great! I guess I'm just too worried about staying in key.",
"I love that you don't just do whatever's popular. Like, who cares if anyone likes you, right?"]
